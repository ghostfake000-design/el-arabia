Place your program icon (PNG) here as `icon-source.png`.

Steps:

1. Save the image you attached to this conversation into this folder and name it `icon-source.png`.
2. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run make-icon
```

This will create `build/icon.ico` which is used by the installer. If you want me to add the attached image into the repo for you, reply with `ضع الصورة` and I will write it into `assets/icon-source.png`.
